# UDIM-Helper-Tool
UDIM helper tool for 3ds max written in MaxScript.

It’s a Maxscript tool for working with multi tile textures with 3ds MAx 2016 and below. 

How to use: 
- First you need to unwrap the model into different uv spaces. (in one horizontal line max 10) 
- Run the script, it's set the uv spaces to id's. (run i horizontal lines and after 10 jump vertical one and again…max 40) 
- Then paint the model with (The Foundry) Mari(Preferred) or Substance Painter, export textures follow the UDIM standard.(jpg, tif, png,psd) 
- With the second script you can create a multi material from the bitmaps you exported. 
- The multi material contains v-ray materials with instanced bump and self-illum. 
- Apply the material and done!
